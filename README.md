## 👋 Hi, I’m Soufiane (pronounced Souf-Yen)


I’m a **software engineer** and **indie builder** with a **strong product mindset**.
Over the years, I’ve collaborated with different types of organizations, from small teams to large orgs, delivering scalable and meaningful solutions.
I love working across the entire stack, from infrastructure to UI, and from idea to launch.


## 🌱 My Journey
Before working full-time in tech, I spent years in restaurants, retail, and customer support — experiences that taught me empathy, communication, and how thoughtful systems can empower people.
That perspective continues to shape how I build and lead software projects today.

## 🎵 Beyond Code
Outside of work, you’ll often find me:

- 🎶 Making beats or digging through vinyl
- 📸 Shooting and editing photos

Creative work helps me stay curious, balanced, and inspired.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

I’m always open to connecting with other engineers, founders, and indie makers.
If you want to chat about systems design, product ideas, music or creative tech, I’d love to hear from you.
