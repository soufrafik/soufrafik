## 👋 Hi, I'm Soufiane (Souf-Yen)

I'm a software engineer and indie builder who loves taking ideas from concept to launch. I work across the full stack and care deeply about building things that actually work for people.

## 🌱 Background

Before tech, I spent years in restaurants, retail, and support roles. Those experiences taught me empathy and how good systems can make people's lives easier — something I bring to every project I build.

## 🎵 Outside Work

- Making beats and digging through vinyl
- Shooting and editing photos

Creative work keeps me curious and balanced.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

Always happy to connect with engineers, founders, and makers. If you want to chat about systems, product ideas, music, or creative tech — reach out.
